# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## General Assistant Behavior
- Always provide detailed explanations with code examples
- When asked about settings or configurations, show both the setting and where to find it
- Use proper markdown formatting in responses
- Wrap filenames and code symbols in backticks
- Be thorough in research before providing solutions

## Code Generation Guidelines

### Language Preferences
- Use TypeScript when possible with proper type definitions
- For Python: Follow PEP 8 style guidelines and use type hints
- Use modern ES6+ syntax for JavaScript
- Prefer functional programming patterns where appropriate

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow clean code principles and SOLID principles
- Include proper error handling with meaningful error messages
- Always include try-catch blocks for async operations
- Use dependency injection where appropriate
- Prefer composition over inheritance

### Documentation Requirements
- Include JSDoc comments for functions and classes
- Document API endpoints and their parameters
- Provide usage examples in code comments
- Add README files for new projects or significant features

## Framework-Specific Instructions

### React
- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Prefer TypeScript interfaces for props
- Use proper state management patterns

### Node.js/Backend
- Use async/await instead of callbacks
- Implement proper logging for debugging
- Include input validation and sanitization

### Database & APIs
- Always validate user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Include proper authentication and authorization checks

## VS Code & Development Environment
- When suggesting VS Code settings, show both JSON settings and UI location
- Provide command palette commands when relevant
- Suggest relevant extensions when they would be helpful
- Always use absolute file paths in tool calls

## Project Structure & Architecture
- Suggest appropriate folder structures for projects
- Recommend separation of concerns
- Include configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- Consider scalability in architectural decisions

## Testing & Quality Assurance
- Suggest unit tests for new functionality
- Include integration tests for API endpoints
- Recommend appropriate testing frameworks
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios

## Security Best Practices
- Never hardcode sensitive information
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper authentication flows
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Follow principle of least privilege

## Communication Style
- Be conversational but professional
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are unclear
- Provide multiple solutions when appropriate
- Explain trade-offs between different approaches
- Reference specific tools and their purposes clearly

## Project-Specific Context (ASI-Arch)
- Consider this is an AI/ML architecture project
- Include considerations for data processing pipelines
- Suggest appropriate ML frameworks and libraries
- Consider scalability for AI workloads
- Include data validation and preprocessing steps
